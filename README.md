Recreate the card game called "War"

Let's have a quick overview of the game: wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)

Start of with 52 cards deck, and the after shuffling the deck, we split it up into two decks for 2 players

And now these two players will grab one of their cards and lay on the table, and the card that has the higher ranking wins. And when a player wins this matchup, they take both cards and they go into their deck.

The player that loses is the one that has no more cards remaining

To construct this game, we will create:
  Card Class (suit, rank, value)
  Deck Class
  Player Class
  Game Logic
  
 In this game, we're not actually going to have a human player. Instead, we're going to just be simulating a game of war between two computer players
